Cloud Guardrails
================

This document focuses on a **preliminary set of baseline security
controls** to ensure that the cloud service environment has a minimum
set of configurations for the cloud environment. Departments are
expected to must implement, validate, and report on in the first 30
business days.

Departments are responsible for implementing the minimum configurations
identified in the table below. Validation of the guardrails will be
performed by SSC Cloud Services Directorate. The [Standard Operating
Procedure (SOP) on Validating Cloud
Guardrails](https://www.gcpedia.gc.ca/gcwiki/images/1/19/SOP_for_Validating_Cloud_Guardrails.pdf)
has been developed to support this activity.

For this document the following definitions will be used:

-   Mandatory requirements: A set of baseline security controls that
    > departments must implement, validate, and report on in the first
    > 30 business days.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Additional considerations: Additional security controls that are
    > highly recommended and should be taken into consideration. While
    > these are not expected to be implemented within 30 business days,
    > they include best practices that should be considered as
    > departments progress with the establishment of their cloud-based
    > environments.
